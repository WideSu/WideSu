- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Artificial Intelligence at Singapore Management University and will graduate in Feb 2023
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Reinforcement Learning, doing MySQL on HanckerRank, and doing LeetCode algorithm exercises
- âœ¨ I'm doing a full-time internship(6th Dec 2021- 6th Jun 2022) as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern in IKAS Industry, a company focusing on AI algorithms, real-time planning, and scheduling in the semi-conductor domain. I think AI in the semi-conductor domain is promising since China is promoting their research in chips and our research can help them to optimize their decisions in factories. I have done two projects. One is the classification problem: predictive maintenance for time series data of machines. The other is regression problem: optimizing the temperature adjustment algorithm for producing wafers using all kinds of regression algorithms.
- âš¡ And actively seeking 2022 part-time research assistant jobs. I will start to apply for a Ph.D. degree from August 2022 in AI for the 2023 January intake
